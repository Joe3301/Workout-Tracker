# Workout Tracker

A simple Android app to track your workouts with. 

The inspiration for this app came from the paper spreadsheet I would carry around with me while at the gym. Wouldn't it be easier to replace that spreadsheet and pencil with an app? Yes it would!

Features:
- Easily create individual workouts, each with its own list of exercises
- Each exercise has a corresponding weight and rep count
- Rename, move, and edit individual exercises with ease
- View previous workouts and edit or add new exercises
- <b>Work in progress: Workout Mode, an interactive mode to be used while at the gym </b>

Currently in development/needs to be added:
- Ability to rename workout
- Workout Mode
- Create different journals (currently there is only one master journal). This requires a restructuring of the entire app
- Add licensing information to all the different code files

For now, the weight is in pounds (lbs) since I'm primarily developing this app for personal use. There aren't plans to be able to convert/switch between units right now, but if requested, that could be added in the future.


This is my first Android app, so the code may not be 100% perfect or conform to correct Android programming practices. I'm still learning the Android SDK as I go, so if some comments seem redundant or if there's a better way to do something, that's probably why. That being said, if you have any suggestions/tips for me or would like to contribute to the project, feel free to either create an issue or leave a comment.
